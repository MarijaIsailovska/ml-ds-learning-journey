Problem: Group Anagrams
Source: LeetCode #49
Difficulty: Medium
Date Solved: 2024-07-23

Problem Description:
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return
the answer in any order. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging
the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original
letters exactly once.

Approach:
Use sorted string as a key in hash map to group anagrams. Words with the same
sorted characters are anagrams and will have the same key.

Time Complexity: O(n * k log k) where n = number of strings, k = max string length
Space Complexity: O(n * k) for storing all strings and their keys

Key Insights:
- Anagrams have identical sorted character sequences
- defaultdict(list) simplifies grouping logic
- tuple(sorted(word)) creates hashable key for dictionary

"""
Personal Reflection:
- Time to solve: _20__ minutes
- Difficulty rating (1-5): _2__/5
- What I learned: Using sorted string as dictionary key for grouping
- Mistakes made: 
- Key insight: tuple(sorted(word)) creates perfect hashable key for anagrams

Your Code Strengths:
1. **Smart Key Choice:** tuple(sorted(words)) is brilliant
   - Tuple is hashable (can be dict key)
   - Sorted string uniquely identifies anagram group

2. **defaultdict Usage:** Eliminates need to check if key exists
   - Cleaner code than regular dict
   - Automatically creates empty list for new keys

3. **Clean Logic:** Simple one-pass solution
   - Easy to understand and maintain
   - Handles all edge cases naturally

Code Quality: 9/10
- Very clean and Pythonic
- Good variable names
- Efficient use of built-in functions

Optimization Opportunities:
- For very long strings: character counting approach is O(n*k) vs your O(n*k log k)
- For lowercase-only: array counting even faster
- But your approach is more general and equally readable

Similar Problems to Practice:
- Valid Anagram (foundation problem)
- Find All Anagrams in a String (sliding window)
- Anagrams in a Dictionary (trie-based approach)

Interview Notes:
- Explain why tuple(sorted()) works as a key
- Discuss time complexity: sorting dominates
- Mention alternative approaches and trade-offs
- Show understanding of hashable vs non-hashable types
- Demonstrate knowledge of defaultdict benefits
