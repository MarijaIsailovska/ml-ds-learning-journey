Problem: Two Sum
Source: LeetCode #1
Difficulty: Easy
Date Solved: 2024-07-23

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the
two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input
would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Approach:
Use hash map to store value->index mapping. For each number, check if its
complement (target - current number) exists in the hash map.

Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through array
Space Complexity: O(n) - hash map stores at most n elements

Key Insights:
- Hash map provides O(1) average lookup for complement
- Store numbers we've seen with their indices
- Return immediately when complement is found

"""
Personal Reflection:
- Time to solve: ___ minutes
- Difficulty rating (1-5): ___/5
- What I learned: Hash map for complement search pattern
- Mistakes made: 
- Key insight: Single pass is possible by checking complement before storing

Similar Problems to Practice:
- Two Sum II (sorted array - use two pointers instead)
- 3Sum (extend to three numbers)
- Two Sum IV (binary search tree)

Interview Notes:
- Always ask about constraints (array size, number ranges, duplicate values)
- Discuss trade-offs: time vs space complexity
- Mention alternative approaches (brute force, sorting)
- Consider edge cases: empty array, no solution, duplicate numbers
