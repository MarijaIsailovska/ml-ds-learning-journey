Problem: Valid Anagram
Source: LeetCode #242
Difficulty: Easy
Date Solved: 2024-07-23

Problem Description:
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word
or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Approach:
Sort both strings and compare them. If they're equal after sorting, they contain
the same characters in the same frequencies, making them anagrams.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - due to sorting both strings
Space Complexity: O(1) if sorting is in-place, O(n) for the sorted strings

Key Insights:
- Anagrams have identical character frequencies
- Sorting reveals the canonical form of character arrangement
- Simple and intuitive approach

Personal Reflection:
- Time to solve: ___ minutes
- Difficulty rating (1-5): ___/5
- What I learned: Sorting approach is intuitive but not most efficient
- Mistakes made: 
- Key insight: Multiple ways to solve - sorting vs frequency counting

Approach Comparison:
1. **Sorting (Your approach):**
   - Pros: Simple, intuitive, works with any characters
   - Cons: O(n log n) time complexity
   
2. **Hash Map:**
   - Pros: O(n) time, general solution
   - Cons: More complex code
   
3. **Array counting:**
   - Pros: O(n) time, O(1) space, fastest for lowercase letters
   - Cons: Limited to specific character set

Similar Problems to Practice:
- Group Anagrams (categorize multiple strings)
- Find All Anagrams in a String (substring anagrams)
- Minimum Window Substring (character frequency matching)

Interview Notes:
- Ask about constraints: character set (lowercase only?), string length
- Discuss trade-offs: time vs space, simplicity vs efficiency
- Mention multiple approaches and when to use each
- Consider follow-up: what if strings are very long? (sorting might be better due to space)
