## üìê Module 4: Probability and Statistics (Detailed)

### 4.1 Fundamentals of Statistics

#### Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing and describing the characteristics of a dataset using measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation
- **Inferential Statistics**: Making predictions, generalizations, or conclusions about a population based on sample data

#### Population vs. Sample
- **Population**: The entire group of individuals, items, or data points of interest
- **Sample**: A subset of the population used to make inferences about the larger group
- **Sampling Methods**: Random sampling, stratified sampling, systematic sampling

### 4.2 Measures of Central Tendency

#### Mean (Arithmetic Average)
The sum of all values divided by the number of values. Sensitive to outliers and best used with symmetric distributions.

#### Median
The middle value when data is arranged in order. More robust to outliers than the mean and preferred for skewed distributions.

#### Mode
The most frequently occurring value in a dataset. Useful for categorical data and understanding the most common occurrence.

#### When to Use Each Measure
- **Symmetric distributions**: Mean is most representative
- **Skewed distributions**: Median provides better central representation
- **Categorical data**: Mode is most appropriate

### 4.3 Measures of Dispersion

#### Range
The difference between the maximum and minimum values. Simple but sensitive to outliers.

#### Variance
The average of the squared differences from the mean. Provides a measure of how spread out the data points are from the center.

#### Standard Deviation
The square root of variance, expressed in the same units as the original data. Easier to interpret than variance.

#### Interquartile Range (IQR)
The difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and 25th percentile (Q1). Robust to outliers and useful for identifying data spread in the middle 50% of values.

#### Coefficient of Variation
The ratio of standard deviation to the mean, useful for comparing variability between datasets with different scales or units.

### 4.4 Probability Theory

#### Basic Probability Concepts
- **Experiment**: Any process that generates well-defined outcomes
- **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes
- **Event**: A subset of the sample space
- **Probability**: A measure of the likelihood of an event occurring (0 ‚â§ P(A) ‚â§ 1)

#### Probability Rules
- **Addition Rule**: P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ‚à© B)
- **Multiplication Rule**: P(A ‚à© B) = P(A) √ó P(B|A)
- **Complement Rule**: P(A') = 1 - P(A)

#### Conditional Probability
The probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred: P(A|B) = P(A ‚à© B) / P(B)

#### Independence
Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other: P(A|B) = P(A)

### 4.5 Probability Distributions

#### Discrete Probability Distributions

**Bernoulli Distribution**
- Models a single trial with two possible outcomes (success/failure)
- Parameters: p (probability of success)
- Applications: Quality control, A/B testing

**Binomial Distribution**
- Models the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials
- Parameters: n (number of trials), p (probability of success)
- Applications: Survey analysis, clinical trials

**Poisson Distribution**
- Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space
- Parameter: Œª (average rate of occurrence)
- Applications: Call center management, website traffic analysis

#### Continuous Probability Distributions

**Normal (Gaussian) Distribution**
- Bell-shaped, symmetric distribution
- Parameters: Œº (mean), œÉ (standard deviation)
- Central Limit Theorem: Sample means approach normal distribution
- Applications: Heights, weights, measurement errors

**Uniform Distribution**
- All outcomes in a range are equally likely
- Parameters: a (minimum), b (maximum)
- Applications: Random number generation, simulation

**Exponential Distribution**
- Models time between events in a Poisson process
- Parameter: Œª (rate parameter)
- Applications: Survival analysis, reliability engineering

### 4.6 Hypothesis Testing

#### Fundamental Concepts
- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: Statement of no effect or no difference
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: Statement that contradicts the null hypothesis
- **Significance Level (Œ±)**: Threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis (commonly 0.05)
- **P-value**: Probability of observing results as extreme as those obtained, assuming H‚ÇÄ is true

#### Type I and Type II Errors
- **Type I Error (Œ±)**: Rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive)
- **Type II Error (Œ≤)**: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative)
- **Power (1-Œ≤)**: Probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis

#### Common Hypothesis Tests

**One-Sample Tests**
- **One-sample t-test**: Testing if a sample mean differs from a known population mean
- **One-sample proportion test**: Testing if a sample proportion differs from a known population proportion

**Two-Sample Tests**
- **Independent t-test**: Comparing means of two independent groups
- **Paired t-test**: Comparing means of the same subjects under two conditions
- **Two-proportion z-test**: Comparing proportions between two groups

**Chi-Square Tests**
- **Goodness of fit**: Testing if observed frequencies match expected frequencies
- **Test of independence**: Testing if two categorical variables are independent

#### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- **One-way ANOVA**: Comparing means across multiple groups
- **Two-way ANOVA**: Examining effects of two factors simultaneously
- **F-statistic**: Ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance

### 4.7 Statistical Inference

#### Confidence Intervals
Range of values that likely contains the true population parameter with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval).

#### Margin of Error
The maximum expected difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter.

#### Sample Size Determination
Calculating the minimum sample size needed to achieve desired precision and power for statistical tests.

#### Assumptions and Conditions
Understanding when statistical methods are valid:
- **Normality**: Data follows approximately normal distribution
- **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other
- **Homoscedasticity**: Equal variances across groups
- **Random sampling**: Sample is representative of population

### 4.8 Practical Applications in Data Science

#### A/B Testing
Using hypothesis testing to compare different versions of products, websites, or treatments to determine which performs better.

#### Quality Control
Applying statistical methods to monitor and maintain product or service quality within acceptable limits.

#### Predictive Analytics
Using probability distributions and statistical inference to make predictions about future events or behaviors.

#### Risk Assessment
Quantifying uncertainty and variability to make informed decisions under uncertainty.
